# A deep learning material
## Created ANN
### I created a class for classification purpose (the main goal of this project).

1. Implemented in Python, used PyTorch and scikit-learn packages.
2. After training the machine over CIFAR-10 training set and validation set, the architecture has made accuracy of 84.69% on the test set.
3. I ran the code on Google Colab's GPU.
4. This was for introduction to deep learning course final project.
