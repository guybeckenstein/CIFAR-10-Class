### This is a deep learning material ###

Implemented in Python, used PyTorch and scikit-learn packages. I created a class for classification purpose (the main goal of this project).
After training the machine over CIFAR-10 training set and validation set, the architecture has made accuracy of 84.69% on the test set.
I ran the code on Google Colab's GPU.
This was for introduction to deep learning course final project.
